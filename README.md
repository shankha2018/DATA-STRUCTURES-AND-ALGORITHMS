# 1.ARRAYS:
An array is collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.The memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array)is the base address adding an offset to which makes the task of finding the position of each element easier.

# Types of indexing in array:
1. 0 (zero-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by 0

2. 1 (one-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by 1

3. n (n-based indexing): The base index of an array can be freely chosen. Usually programming languages allowing n-based indexing also allow negative index values and other scalar data types like enumerations, or characters may be used as an array index.

# Advantages of using arrays:

1. Arrays allow random access of elements. Accessing elements by position becomes faster.

2. Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.
